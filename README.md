# YhaooHist
YahooHistRaw gets the historical data. This should be used.
<p>YahooQuoteRaw gets current prices. This should be used.
  <h2> Things to do </h2>
  Get results from hist data and current day's data and merge them.
  <p> Sometimes we have current day's data in hist, in that case we do not need to merge.
  <p> For dates prior than current date, we should not call current day's data.
